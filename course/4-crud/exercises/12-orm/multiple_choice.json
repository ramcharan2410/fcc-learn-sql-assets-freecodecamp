  ],
  "correctAnswer":"Call methods and functions made available via the ORM's API",
  "reason":"When using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping), you typically call methods and functions made available via the ORM's API rather than writing a lot of raw SQL. The primary purpose of an ORM is to abstract away the low-level SQL queries and provide a higher-level, object-oriented interface for interacting with a relational database."
