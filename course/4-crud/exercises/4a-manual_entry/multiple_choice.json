    "Generated by code",
    "Written by hand"
  ],
  "correctAnswers":"Both",
  "reason":"Within backend systems, SQL queries can be generated by code or written by hand, depending on the specific requirements and design of the application. 1. **Generated by Code**: In many modern web applications, especially those using ORMs (Object-Relational Mapping) like Sequelize (for Node.js), Hibernate (for Java), or Django ORM (for Python), SQL queries are often generated automatically by the code. Developers define models or classes that map to database tables, and the ORM generates SQL queries to interact with the database based on high-level operations (e.g., saving an object, querying records) without the need for manually written SQL. 2. **Written by Hand**: In some cases, developers may write SQL queries manually when they need to perform complex, custom, or optimized database operations that are not easily expressed through the ORM or when they want precise control over the queries. Handwritten SQL queries are common when working with legacy databases or when performance tuning is critical. The choice between generating SQL queries through code or writing them by hand depends on factors like the complexity of the application, the developer's familiarity with SQL, the presence of an ORM, and performance considerations. Both approaches have their advantages and trade-offs, and the choice often comes down to the specific needs of the project."
